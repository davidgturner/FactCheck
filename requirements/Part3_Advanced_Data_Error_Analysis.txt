Can you conduct an advanced error data analysis on the attached file? It should be from the perspective of picking out a random 
set of 10 False Positives (Where predicted was Supported, but Golden Truth Label was Not Supported) and 10 False Negatives where model was saying predicted was Not Supported, but the Golden Label said Supported.

We can delve deeper into these together, but just wanted a good sample to work with.
