He then made an extended cameo as the sophisticated right-hand man of the mob boss in action noir \\&quot;Fate\\&quot; (2008). In 2009, Ji Sung collaborated again with writer Choi Wan-kyu and director Yoo Chul-yong of \\&quot;All In\\&quot; in the revenge drama \\&quot;Swallow the Sun\\&quot;, adapted from the novel by Kang Chul-hwa, and shot on location in Jeju Island, Las Vegas and South Africa. Ji Sung trained hard to play the tough, strong-willed protagonist who goes to prison for his boss and later becomes involved in the city development of Jeju. In February 2010, he signed with a new management agency, Namoo Actors. Several months later, he played another historical character in \\&quot;Kim Su-ro, The Iron King\\&quot;, as the titular founder of Geumgwan Gaya.
